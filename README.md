<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
This repository contains a complete compiler for the "L" programming language, which translates "L" programs to MIPS assembly code. The project was developed as part of a compilation course at Tel Aviv University. It is structured into four exercises, each focusing on a distinct phase of the compilation process:

1. **Exercise 1 - Lexical Scanner**: Implementation of a JFlex-based lexical scanner for tokenizing the input program.
2. **Exercise 2 - CUP Based Parser**: Utilizes CUP to check the syntax and create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for the input program.
3. **Exercise 3 - Semantic Analyzer**: Implements a recursive scan of the AST to detect and report any semantic errors.
4. **Exercise 4 - Code Generation**: Translates the enriched AST into MIPS assembly code, involving intermediate representation (IR) creation, translation to MIPS instructions, and register allocation.


**Each exercise has its dedicated folder within the repository (i.e ex1, ex2..), containing the source code and any relevant files**

# Exercise 1 - A lexical scanner based on JFlex.

The first exercise implements a lexical scanner for the "L" programming language using JFlex. The scanner is designed to tokenize an input "L" program and generate a tokenized representation of the input. 

## Specifications
The full specification can be found [Here](./ex1/ex1.pdf)

- **Identifiers:** May contain letters and digits and must start with a letter. Certain keywords cannot be used as identifiers, including: class, nil, array, while, int, extends, return, new, if, string.
- **Whitespace:** Consists of spaces, tabs, and newline characters and may appear between any tokens.
- **Comments:** Similar to C-style comments. Two types of comments are recognized: Type-1 comments (//...) and Type-2 comments (/*...*/). Unclosed Type-2 comments are considered lexical errors.
- **Integers:** Represented as sequences of digits. Leading zeroes are considered lexical errors. Limited to 16-bit signed values between 0 and $2^{15}$-1.
- **Strings:** Sequences of letters between double quotes. Strings containing non-letter characters are lexical errors. Unclosed strings are also considered lexical errors.

### Token Descriptions

The exercise defines various token names, including parentheses, brackets, braces, operators, keywords, integers, identifiers, strings, and types. The output format for each token includes the token name, line number, and character position inside that line, along with associated values where applicable.

## Input and Output

- **Input:** The input for this exercise is a single text file containing an "L" program.
- **Output:** A single text file that contains a tokenized representation of the input program. Each token appears on a separate line, along with the line number it appeared on and the character position inside that line. In case of any lexical error, the output file should contain the word "ERROR."


## Running the Lexical Scanner

To run the Lexical Scanner for the "L" programming language, please ensure that JFlex is set up properly on your Linux system (or WSL). You can follow the setup instructions provided in the next section before proceeding with the steps below.

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the "ex1" directory within the repository.
3. Open a terminal window in this directory.

### Running the Program

In the terminal, run the following command:

```bash
make
```
This command performs the following steps:
- Generates the source code file src/Lexer.java based on the JFlex specifications.
- Compiles the modules into LEXER.
- Runs the LEXER on input/Input.txt
- outputs the result to output/OutputTokens.txt and to the terminal
